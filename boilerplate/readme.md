This interactive proportional symbol map, built using Leaflet, shows the passenger traffic of 15 of the world's busiest airports from October 2019 through June 2020. This time period was chosen to look at passenger traffic before the pandemic started and while it was ongoing, and how passenger traffic varied in different airports in different countries and continents.
