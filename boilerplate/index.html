            <h3>Unprecedented Times</h3>
            <p>Airline travel has revolutionized how people interact with each other. One can fly to the other side of the world within 24 hours, depending on the route, whereas a couple centuries ago, it would take weeks, if not months. <a href="https://www.travelweekly.com/Travel-News/Airline-News/Air-travel-growth-slowed-worldwide-in-2019">Global air travel</a> has grown steadily the past decade, even though 2019 saw a slow pace for the previous ten years. And then <em>COVID-19</em> began to spread. What started as something mainly in East Asia began to spread around the world, without a doubt, by the help of airline travel. Click the airplane icons or use the slider to see the changes to passenger traffic of 15 of the busiest airports in the world from October 2019 to June 2020.
